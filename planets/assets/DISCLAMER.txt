It is to be noted that several mods have reused OWG textures and assets for their 
own mods. I have done this before with NHE's assets as well. However, any "custom"
textures that are not directly sourced from NHE or from other games 
[KSP/Outer Wilds/Space Engine] are NOT to be used in other mods unless givin
permission. If you have any questions about which assets are free to use please 
ask me. [◢Jammer◣#5048]

This is mainly future proofing for when I start to use custom textures.
